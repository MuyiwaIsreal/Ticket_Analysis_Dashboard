## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a Power BI dashboard that not only captivates visually but also efficiently presents key insights.

The aim is to provide stakeholders with a tool that facilitates informed decision-making by offering strategic insights in a clear and understandable manner. Through this dashboard, stakeholders will be empowered to decipher complex data effortlessly, thus enabling them to make well-informed strategic decisions with ease.

## About Dataset:
The dataset provided for this project spans from January 2020 to March 2024 and contains 84,353 entries related to ticketing system data.

It is meticulously structured to facilitate comprehensive analysis of IT service management operations, including ticket handling efficiency, agent performance, and adherence to service level agreements. The dataset includes information such as ticket IDs, employee and agent IDs, request categories, severity and priority levels, resolution times, satisfaction rates, SLA status, the date the ticket was opened, and the type of work involved to supports detailed reporting and visualization, enabling data-driven decision-making and performance optimization.

## Tool Used:
In line with the objectives and project requirements, I have utilized Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, for dashboard creation. Additionally, I have employed Excel to some extent to ensure that the data is formatted clearly and in a usable manner.
